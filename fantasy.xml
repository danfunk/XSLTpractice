'''[[Science fiction studies]]''' is the academic discipline that studies works of speculative and science fiction. Science fiction is used broadly to cover the publishing genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and other related non-realistic works.  [[Utopian studies]] and [[futurism]] are closely related subjects, as are many relevant subfields of [[literary criticism|literary]] and [[film criticism]].

{{Fantasy}}
&lt;!-- This article is about FANTASY and not folklore, mythology or oral literature.  Any of the latter should be introduced only with an explanation about their relationship to fantasy. --&gt;

Though the '''[[fantasy]]''' genre in its modern sense is less than two centuries old, its '''sources''' have a long and distinguished history. Elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were an element of literature from its beginning.

In ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', [[John Clute]] and John Grant separated the concept of fantasy as such from that of '''taproot texts''', works that are sources for fantasy, but not themselves fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;taproot&quot;&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Taproot texts&quot;, p 921 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Near East==
The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' was written over generations following the supposed reign of King Gilgamesh, and is seen as a mythologized version of his life. This figure is sometimes an influence and, more rarely, a figure in modern fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, p 410 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' is a source used by the authors of the ''[[Bible]]'', specifically the story of ''[[Noah]]'' and the flood.

==Ancient India==
[[India]] has a long tradition of fantastical stories and characters, dating back to [[Vedic mythology]]. Several modern fantasy works such as ''[[RG Veda]]'' draw on the ''[[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]]'' as a source. [[Hindu mythology]] was an evolution of the earlier Vedic mythology and had many more fantastical stories and characters, particularly in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]], such as the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' by [[Vyasa]], and the ''[[Ramayana]]'' by [[Valmiki]], both of which were influential in Asia. The ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (''Fables of Bidpai'') was influential in Europe and the [[Middle East]]. It used various animal [[fable]]s and magical tales to illustrate the central Indian principles of [[political science]]. Talking animals endowed with human qualities have now become a staple of modern fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Matthews (2002). ''Fantasy: The Liberation of Imagination'', p. 8-10. [[Routledge]]. ISBN 0-415-93890-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' (''Vikram and the Vampire'') is a collection of various fantasy tales set within a [[frame story]] about an encounter between King [[Vikramāditya]] and a [[Vetala]], an early mythical creature resembling a [[vampire]]. According to [[Richard Francis Burton]] and [[Isabel Burton]], the ''Baital Pachisi'' &quot;is the germ which culminated in the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', and which inspired the ''[[Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]], [[Boccacio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decamerone]],'' the ''[[Pentamerone]],'' and all that class of facetious fictitious literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Isabel Burton]], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/goth/vav/vav02.htm Preface], in [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1870), ''Vikram and The Vampire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Roman==

[[Classical mythology]] is replete with fantastical stories and characters, the best known (and perhaps the most relevant to modern fantasy) being the works of [[Homer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;taproot&quot; /&gt;

The philosophy of [[Plato]] has had great influence on the fantasy genre.  In the Christian Platonic tradition, the reality of other worlds, and an overarching structure of great metaphysical and moral importance, has lent substance to the fantasy worlds of modern works.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 229 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== East Asia ==
The figures of [[Chinese dragon]]s were influential on the modern fantasy use of the [[dragon]], tempering the greedy, thoroughly evil, even diabolical Western dragon; many modern fantasy dragons are humane and wise.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Chinese traditions have been particularly influential in the vein of fantasy known as [[Chinoiserie]], including such writers as [[Ernest Bramah]] and [[Barry Hughart]].&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, &quot;Chinoiserie&quot;, p 189 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoist beliefs about [[neijin]] and its influence on [[martial arts]] have been a major influence on [[Wuxia]], a sub-genre of the martial arts film that is sometimes fantasy, when the practice of [[Wuxia#The Use of Wushu|wuxia]] is used fictitiously to achieve super-human feats, as in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Yin, [http://www.heroic-cinema.com/eric/xia.html &quot;A Definition of Wuxia and Xia&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Middle East==
[[File:Ali-Baba.jpg|right|thumb|&quot;Ali Baba&quot; by [[Maxfield Parrish]].]]

The most well known fiction from the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] was ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian Nights)'', which was a compilation of many ancient and medieval folk tales. The epic took form in the tenth century and reached its final form by the fourteenth century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights&quot;&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Arabian fantasy&quot;, p 51 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  All Arabian fairy tales were often called &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights'', in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; despite existing in no Arabic manuscript.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights&quot;/&gt;

This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by [[Antoine Galland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 10 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt; Many imitations were written, especially in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights2&quot;&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Arabian fantasy&quot;, p 52 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]].  Part of its popularity may have sprung from the increasing historical and geographical knowledge, so that places of which little was known and so marvels were plausible had to be set further &quot;long ago&quot; or farther &quot;far away&quot;; this is a process that continue, and finally culminate in the [[fantasy world]] having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.

A number of elements from Persian and Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as [[genie]]s, [[bahamut]]s, [[magic carpet]]s, magic lamps, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabianNights2&quot;/&gt;  When [[L. Frank Baum]] proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.&lt;ref&gt;James Thurber, &quot;The Wizard of Chitenango&quot;, p 64 ''Fantasists on Fantasy'' edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, ISBN 0-380-86553-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of [[Iran]], is a mythical and heroic retelling of [[History of Iran|Persian history]]. ''[[Amir Arsalan]]'' was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as ''[[The Heroic Legend of Arslan]]''.&lt;!-- one work is not noteworthy enough to include in this article--&gt;

==Medieval Europe==
Medieval European sources of fantasy occurred primarily in [[epic poetry]] and in the [[Fornaldarsaga]]s, [[Norse saga|Norse]] and [[Iceland]]ic [[saga]]s, both of which are based on ancient [[oral tradition]].  The influence of these works on the German Romantics, as well as [[William Morris]], and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] means that their influence on later fantasy has been large.&lt;ref name=&quot;nordic&quot;&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Nordic fantasy&quot;, p 692 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thor.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Thor's battle against the giants, by Marten Eskil Winge, 1872]]

===Anglo-Saxon===
''[[Beowulf]]'' is among the best known of the Nordic tales in the English speaking world, and has had deep influence on the fantasy genre; although it was unknown for centuries and so not developed in medieval legend and romance, several fantasy works have retold the tale, such as [[John Champlin Gardner, Jr.|
John Gardner]]'s ''[[Grendel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Beowulf&quot;, p 107 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norse===
[[Norse mythology]], as found in the [[Elder Edda]] and the [[Younger Edda]], includes such figures as [[Odin]] and his fellow [[Aesir]], and [[Norse dwarf|dwarves]], [[Elf|elves]], [[European dragon|dragon]]s, and [[Jötunn|giants]].&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Nordic fantasy&quot;, p 691 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  These elements have been directly imported into various fantasy works, and have deeply influenced others, both on their own and through their influence on Nordic sagas, Romanticism, and early fantasy writers.

The '''[[Fornaldarsaga]]s''', literally ''tales of times past'', or ''Legendary sagas'', occasionally drew upon these older myths for fantasic elements.  Such works as ''[[Grettis saga]]'' carried on that tradition; the heroes often embark on dangerous quests where they fight the forces of evil, dragons, witchkings, barrow-wights, and rescue fair maidens.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Saga&quot;, p 831 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Fornalder, peter nicolai arbo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''Fornalder''' (''times past''), painting by [[Peter Nicolai Arbo]]]]
More historical sagas, such as  ''[[Volsunga saga|Völsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', feature conflicts over thrones and dynasties that also reflect many motifs commonly found in [[epic fantasy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nordic&quot;/&gt;
 
The starting point of the fornaldarsagas' influence on the creation of the Fantasy genre is the publication, in 1825, of the most famous Swedish literary work ''[[Frithjof's saga]]'', which was based on the ''[[Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna]]'', and it became an instant success in [[England]] and [[Germany]]. It is said to have been translated twenty-two times into English, twenty times into German, and once at least into every European language, including modern Icelandic in 1866. Their influence on authors, such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[William Morris]] and [[Poul Anderson]] and on the subsequent modern fantasy genre is considerable, and can perhaps not be overstated.

===Celtic===
[[File:Maev.jpg|right|thumb|Queen [[Maeve|Maev]]]]
Celtic folklore and legend has been an inspiration for many fantasy works.  The separate folklore of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland has sometimes been used indiscriminately for &quot;Celtic&quot; fantasy, sometimes with great effect; other writers have distinguished to use a single source.&lt;ref name=&quot;celtic&quot;&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Celtic fantasy&quot;, p 275 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wales|Welsh]] tradition has been particularly influential, owing to its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work, the epic [[Mabinogion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;celtic&quot; /&gt;  One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of [[Evangeline Walton]]:  ''[[The Island of the Mighty]]'', ''[[The Children of Llyr]]'', ''[[The Song of Rhiannon]]'', and ''[[Prince of Annwn]]''.  A notable amount of fiction has been written in the area of Celtic fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 101 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish [[Ulster Cycle]] and [[Fenian Cycle]] have also been plentifully mined for fantasy.&lt;ref name=&quot;celtic&quot; /&gt;

Scottish tradition is less used, perhaps because of the spurious nature of the [[Ossian]] cycle, a nineteenth century fraud claiming to have much older sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;celtic&quot; /&gt;

Its greatest influence was, however, indirect.  Celtic folklore and mythology provided a major source for the Arthurian cycle of [[chivalric romance]]:  the [[Matter of Britain]].  Although the subject matter was heavily reworked by the authors, these romances developed marvels until they became independent of the original folklore and fictional, an important stage in the development of fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy:  from 1200 to the Present'' p 12 ISBN 0-268-00790-X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnish===
The [[Finland|Finnish]] epic, the [[Kalevala]], although not published until the 19th century, is compiled from oral tradition dating back to an earlier period.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] cited it, with the Finnish language he learned from it, as a major inspiration behind the [[Silmarillion]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippley, ''The Road to [[Middle-earth]]'', p 242-3, ISBN 0-628-25760-8 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (8) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance==

During the Renaissance, [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] wrote and published ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'', a collection of stories, many of which are literary [[fairy tale]]s [[Giambattista Basile]] wrote and published the ''Pentamerone'', a collection of literary fairy tales, the first collection of stories to contain solely the stories later to be known as fairy tales.  Both of these works includes the oldest recorded form of many well-known (and more obscure) European fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Swann Jones, ''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, ISBN 0-8057-0950-9, p38&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the beginning of a tradition that would both influence the fantasy genre and be incorporated in it, as many works of [[fairytale fantasy]] appear to this day.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 11 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although witchcraft and wizardry were both believed to be actual at the time, such motifs as the fairies in  [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', the Weird Sisters in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and Prospero in ''[[The Tempest]]'' (or Doctor Faustus in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s [[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|play]]) would be deeply influential on later works of fantasy.

In a work on [[alchemy]] in the 16th century, [[Paracelsus]] identified four types of beings with the four elements of alchemy: [[gnome]]s, earth elementals; [[Ondine (mythology)|undine]]s, water elementals; [[sylph]]s, air elementals; and [[salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]], fire elementals.&lt;ref&gt;Carole B. Silver, ''Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness'', p 38 ISBN 0-19-512100-6 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (6) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these beings are found in folklore as well as alchemy; their names are often used interchangeably with similar beings from folklore.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p135 ISBN 0-512-47735-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as [[elemental]]s, they are often used in fantasy works as personifications of the forces of nature.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Elemental&quot; p 313-4, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanticism==
[[Romanticism]], a movement of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, was a dramatic reaction to Classicism, challenging the priority of religion and promoting the importance of imagination.  Its success in rehabilitating imagination was of fundamental importance to the evolution of fantasy, and its interest in medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] providing many motifs to modern fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Romanticism&quot;, p 821 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|right|thumb|[[Arthur Rackham]], illustration to ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'']]
In the later part of the Romantic tradition, in reaction to the spirit of the Enlightenment, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and brought them out in printed form.  The [[Brothers Grimm]] were inspired in their collection, ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'', by the movement of [[German Romanticism]].  Many other collectors were inspired by the Grimms and the similar sentiments.  Frequently their motives stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from [[Romantic nationalism]], in that many were inspired to save their own country's folklore:  sometimes, as in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', they compiled existing folklore into an epic to match other nation's; sometimes, as in ''[[Ossian]]'', they fabricated folklore that should have been there.  These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 35 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the nationalistic elements confusing the collections, this movement not only preserved many instances of the folktales that involved magic and other fantastical elements, it provided a major source for later fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide of Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Liar to Hero's Quest'', pp. 38-42, ISBN 08711161958 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Invalid length.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the literary fairy tale developed so smoothly into fantasy that many later works (such as [[Max Beerbohm]]'s ''[[The Happy Hypocrite]]'' and [[George MacDonald]]'s ''[[Phantastes]]'') that would now be called fantasies were called fairy tales at the time they written.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Irwin, ''The Game of the Impossible'', p 92-3, University of Illinois Press, Urbana Chicago London, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;   [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s seminal essay on fantasy writing was titled &quot;[[On Fairy Stories]].&quot;

''Ossian'' and the ballads also provided an influence to fantasy indirectly, through their influence on [[Sir Walter Scott]], who began the genre of [[historical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 79 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Very few of his works contain fantastic elements; in most, the appearance of such is explained away,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Scott, (Sir) Walter&quot;, p 845 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; but in its themes of adventure in a strange society, this led to the adventures set in foreign lands, by [[H. Rider Haggard]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 80-1 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Burrough's works fall in the area of [[science fiction]] because of their (often thin) justifications for their marvels,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Burroughs, Edgar Rice&quot;, p 152 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt; Haggard's included many fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Haggard, H. Rider &quot;, p 444-5 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of [[Alexandre Dumas, père]], romantic historical fiction, contained many fantasy tropes in their realistic settings.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Dumas, Alexandre père&quot;, p 300 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these authors influenced fantasy for the plots, characters and landscapes used—particularly in the [[sword and sorcery]] genre, with such writers as [[Robert E. Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 82 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
Though the [[fantasy]] genre in its modern sense is less than two centuries old, its antecedents have a long and distinguished history.  Elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were an element of literature from its beginning.  The hallmarks that distinguish the modern genre from tales that merely contain fantastic elements are the logic of the fantasy workings, the acknowledged fictitious nature of the work, and the authorship of the elements, rather than their source in folklore.

Works in which the marvels were not necessarily believed, or only half-believed, such as the European [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]]s of chivalry and the tales of the ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', slowly evolved into works that showed these traits.  Such authors as [[George MacDonald]] created explicitly fantastic works.

The publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created an enormous influence on the writing of the field, establishing the form of [[epic fantasy]] and also did much to establish the genre of fantasy as commercially distinct and viable.

==Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works==
{{see also|Sources of fantasy}}

Even the most fantastic myths, legends and fairy tales differ from modern fantasy genre in three respects:
[[File:Orlando Furioso 9.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Illustration to ''Orlando furioso'', featuring the hippogriff, a monster never actually found in folklore.]]
Modern genre fantasy postulates a different reality, either a [[fantasy world]] separated from ours, or a hidden fantasy side of our own world. In addition, the rules, geography, history, etc. of this world tend to be defined, even if they are not described outright. Traditional fantastic tales take place in our world, often in the past or in far off, unknown places. It seldom describes the place or the time with any precision, often saying simply that it happened &quot;long ago and far away.&quot; (A modern, rationalized analog to these stories can be found in the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] tales of the 19th and 20th centuries.)

The second difference is that the supernatural in fantasy is by design fictitious. In traditional tales the degree to which the author considered the supernatural to be real can span the spectrum from legends taken as reality to myths understood as describing in understandable terms more complicated reality, to late, intentionally fictitious literary works.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcock&quot;&gt;[[Michael Moorcock]], ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance:  A Study of Epic Fantasy'' pp 24-25 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the fantastic worlds of modern fantasy are created by an author or group of authors, often using traditional elements, but usually in a novel arrangement and with an individual interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcock&quot;/&gt; Traditional tales with fantasy elements used familiar myths and folklore, and any differences from tradition were considered variations on a theme; the traditional tales were never intended to be separate from the local supernatural folklore. Transitions between the traditional and modern modes of fantastic literature are evident in early [[gothic novel|Gothic]] novels, the [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] in vogue in the 19th century, and  [[Romanticism|Romantic]] novels, all of which used extensively traditional fantastic motifs, but subjected them to authors' concepts.

By one standard, no work created before the fantasy genre was defined can be considered to belong to it, no matter how many fantastic elements it includes. By another, the genre includes the whole range of fantastic literature, both the modern genre and its traditional antecedents, as many elements which were treated as true (or at least not obviously untrue) by earlier authors are wholly fictitious and fantastic for modern readers. But even by the more limited definition a full examination of the history of the fantastic in literature is necessary to show the origins of the modern genre. Traditional works contain significant elements which modern fantasy authors have drawn upon extensively for inspiration in their own works.

The history of French ''{{lang|fr|fantastique}}'' literature is covered in greater detail under ''[[Fantastique]]''.

==Development of fantasy==
=== Romances ===

With increases in learning in the middle of the medieval European era, there appeared beside earlier myths and legends, also literary fiction.  Among the first to appear was the genre of [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]].  This genre embraced fantasy, and not only simply followed traditional myths and fables, but, in its final form, boldly created new marvels from the whole cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy:  from 1200 to the Present'' p 12 ISBN 0-268-00790-X&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:holygrail.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Damsel of the Sanct Grael'', by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]:  medieval romance.]]
Romance at first dealt with traditional themes, above all three thematic cycles of tales, assembled in imagination at a late date as the [[Matter of Rome]] (actually centered on the life and deeds of Alexander the Great), the [[Matter of France]] (Charlemagne and Roland, his principal paladin) and the [[Matter of Britain]] (the lives and deeds of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, within which was incorporated the quest for the Holy Grail);, although a number of &quot;non-cyclical&quot; romances also achieved a great deal of popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laura A. Hibbard]], ''Medieval Romance in England'', New York Burt Franklin,1963 p iii&lt;/ref&gt;

The romances themselves were not entirely believed, but such tales as ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'', ''[[Guillaume de Palerme]]'', and ''[[Queste del Saint Graal]]'' were only the beginning of the fantasy genre, not fully removed from belief.
[[File:George Stubbs 015.jpg|right|thumb|Portrait of Isabella Saltonstall as Una, a character from ''The Faerie Queene'', by [[George Stubbs]].]]
During [[Renaissance]], romance continued to be popular. The trend was to more fantastic fiction.   The English ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' by [[Sir Thomas Malory]] (c.1408–1471), was written in prose; this work dominates the Arthurian literature, often being regarded as the canonical form of the legend.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', &quot;Malory, (Sir) Thomas&quot; p 621, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthurian motifs have appeared steadily in literature from its publication, though the works have been a mix of fantasy and non-fantasy works.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Arthur&quot; p 60-1, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, it and the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (1508), (also prose) spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received, producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto's ''Orlando furioso'' and Torquato Tasso's ''Gerusalemme Liberata''.  Ariosto's tale, with  its endlessly wandering characters, many marvels, and adventures, was a source text for many fantasies of adventure.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Ariosto, Lodovico&quot; p 60-1, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  With such works as ''Amadis of Gaul'' and ''Palmerin of England'', the genre of fantasy was clearly inaugurated, as the marvels are deployed to amaze and surprise readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;moorcock&quot;/&gt;

One English romance is ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' of  [[Edmund Spenser]]. The poem is deeply [[allegorical]] and allusive. Leaving allegory aside, however, the action is that of a typical knightly romance, involving knightly duels, and combats against giants and sorcerers. That is probably the first work in which most of the characters are not men, but [[elf|elves]] (although the difference seems to be rather little). There are mentioned also the wars between [[goblin]]s and [[elf|elves]], which were destined to have a great future in fantastic fiction.

The tale of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' deeply satirized the conventions of the romance, and helped bring about the end of this time of romance, although assisted by other historical trends in fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpragueP9-11&quot;&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 9-11 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, large subgenres of the field of fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, either directly or through their imitation by latter fantasy writer [[William Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 26 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Enlightenment ===
[[File:Cendrillon2.JPG|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Gustave Doré]] to Perrault's ''[[Cinderella]]''.]]

Literary [[fairy tale]]s, such as were written by [[Charles Perrault]], and [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], became very popular, early in this era.  Many of Perrault's tales became fairy tale staples, and influenced latter fantasy as such.  Indeed, when Madame d'Aulnoy termed her works ''contes de fée'' (fairy tales), she invented the term that is now generally used for the genre, thus distinguishing such tales from those involving no marvels.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 858, ISBN 0-393-97636-X&lt;/ref&gt;  This would influence later writers, who took up the folk fairy tales in the same manner, in the Romantic era.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpragueP9-11&quot;/&gt;

Several fantasies aimed at an adult readership were also published in 18th century France,  including [[Voltaire]]'s
&quot;[[philosophical fiction|contes philosophique]]&quot;  &quot;The Princess of Babylon&quot; (1768) and &quot;The White Bull&quot; (1774), and [[Jacques Cazotte]]'s Faustian novel  ''[[The Devil in Love (novel)|The Devil in Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'',p xx, Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005.  ISBN 0-8108-6829-6&lt;/ref&gt;

This era, however, was notably hostile to fantasy.  Writers of the new types of fiction such as Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding were realistic in style, and many early realistic works were critical of fantasical elements in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lin Carter]], ed. ''Realms of Wizardry'' p xiii-xiv Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from a few tales of witchcraft and ghost stories, very little fantasy was written during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpragueP9-11&quot;/&gt;  Even children's literature saw little fantasy; it aimed at edifying and deplored fairy tales as lies.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lochhead, ''Renaissance of Wonder'' p1 ISBN 0-06-250520-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In one respect, this was an essential stage in the development of fantasy as a ''genre''.  The development of a realistic genre ensured that fantasy could be defined as a distinct type, in contrast.

===Romanticism===
[[File:Johann Peter Krafft 001.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]''.]]
In reaction to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s cult of Reason, [[Romanticism]] highly prized the supernatural, tradition and imagination, together with the age in which they were supposed to rule - Middle Ages.  These traits readily borrowed traditional elements of the fantastic.  The Romantics invoked the medieval romance as justification for the works they wanted to produce, in distinction from the realistic pressure of the Enlightenment; these were not always fantastic, sometimes being merely unlikely to happen, but the justification was used even from fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Romance&quot;, p 821 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first literary results of this fascinations was [[Gothic novel]], a literary genre that began in Britain with [[The Castle of Otranto]] ([[1764 in literature|1764]]) by [[Horace Walpole]].   It is the predecessor to both modern fantasy and modern [[horror fiction]] and, above all, has led to the common definition of &quot;gothic&quot; as being connected to the dark and horrific.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpragueP9-11&quot;/&gt; Prominent features of gothic novels included terror, mystery, the supernatural, ghosts, haunted buildings, castles, trapdoors, doom, death, decay, madness, hereditary curses, and so on.  The fantastic, dream-like atmosphere pervaded the genre at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 14 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Gothic tales permitted, but did not require, an element of the supernatural.  Some stories appeared to contain such elements and then explained them away.  The genre straddled the border between fantasy and non-fantasy, but many elements from it, particularly the houses of particular import, being ancient, owned by nobles, and often endowed with legends, were incorporated in modern fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Gothic fantasy&quot;, p 424 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular importance to the development of the genre was that the Gothic writers used novelistic techniques and love, such as Defoe was using, rather than the literary style of the romance, and also began to use the landscape for purposes of expressing the characters' moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 36 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Gothic still held back the pure fantasy.  In ''The Castle of Otranto'', Walpole presented the work as a translation; the fictitious original author is therefore responsible for its fantasical elements, which Walpole distances himself from.&lt;ref&gt;[[Farah Mendlesohn]], ''[[Rhetorics of Fantasy]]'', p 121-2, ISBN 0-8195-6868-6&lt;/ref&gt; One noted Gothic novel which also
contains a large amount of fantasy elements (derived from the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;) is ''[[Vathek]]'' by
[[William Thomas Beckford]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'',p 40, Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005.  ISBN 0-8108-6829-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romantic interest in medievalism also resulted in a revival of interest in the literary [[fairy tale]]. The tradition begun with [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]] and developed by the [[Charles Perrault]] and the French [[précieuses]], was taken up by the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] movement. 
[[Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué]] created medieval-set stories such as ''[[Undine (novella)|Undine]]'' (1811)&lt;ref&gt;

== Modern fantasy ==
The modern fantasy genre first took root during the 18th century with the increased popularity of fictional travelers' tales, influencing and being influenced by other early forms of speculative fiction along the way, finally unfurling in the 19th century from a literary tapestry of fantastic stories and gaining recognition as a distinct genre (mainly due to the nigh-ubiquitous recession of fantastic elements from &quot;mainstream&quot; fiction) in the late 19th century.

===Early modern fantasy===
[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 25.png|thumb|200px|[[John Tenniel]]'s illustration for &quot;A Mad Tea-Party&quot;, 1865]]
In the early Victorian era, stories continued to be told using fantastic elements, less believed in.  [[Charles Dickens]] wrote ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', using novelistic characterization to make his ghost story plausible;&lt;ref name=&quot;PrickettP56-59&quot;&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 56-59 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt; Scrooge at first doubts the reality of the ghosts, suspecting them his own imagination, an explanation that is never conclusively refuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrickettP56-59&quot;/&gt;

The fairy-tale tradition continued in the hands of such authors as [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], but ''[[The Rose and the Ring]]'' showed many elements of parody.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrickettP66-67&quot;&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 66-67 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Christian Andersen]], however, initiated a new style of fairy tales, original tales told in seriousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrickettP66-67&quot;/&gt;  From this origin, [[John Ruskin]] wrote ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'', a fairy tale that uses new levels of characterization, creating in the South-West Wind an irascible but kindly character similar to the later Gandalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrickettP66-67&quot;/&gt;

It was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that modern fantasy genre first truly began to take shape. The history of modern fantasy literature begins with [[George MacDonald]], the Scottish author of such novels as ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' the latter of which is widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for adults. MacDonald also wrote one of the first critical essays about the fantasy genre, &quot;The Fantastic Imagination&quot;, in his book ''A Dish of Orts'' (1893). &lt;ref&gt;George
MacDonald, &quot;The Fantastic Imagination&quot;. Reprinted in Boyer, Robert H. and Zahorski, Kenneth J. ''Fantasists on Fantasy''. New York: Avon Discus, 1984. pp. 11-22, ISBN 0-380-86553-X &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;scholes&quot;&gt;[[Robert Scholes]], &quot;Boiling Roses&quot;
in George E. Slusser, and Eric S. Rabkin, ed., ''Intersections: Fantasy and Science Fiction''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1987.ISBN 080931374X  (pp.3-18). &lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald was a major influence on both [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary K. Wolfe]], &quot;George MacDonald&quot;, pp.239-246

ISBN ISBN 0-684-17808-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Viking funeral.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&quot;The Funeral of a Viking&quot; by [[Frank Bernard Dicksee]]:  the influence of Romanticism and traditional stories on Victorian fantasy meant it was an influence on fantasy as a genre.]]
The other major fantasy author of this era was [[William Morris]], a socialist, an admirer of Middle Ages, a reviver of British handcrafts and a poet, who wrote several fantastic romances and novels in the latter part of the century, of which the most famous was ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.  He was deeply inspired by the medieval romances and sagas; his style was deliberately archaic, based on medieval romances.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarterP2&quot;&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Realms of Wizardry'' p 2 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  In many respects, Morris was an important milestone in the history of fantasy, because, while other writers wrote of foreign lands, or of [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]]s, Morris's works were the first to be set in an entirely invented world:  a [[fantasy world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin Carter p 39&quot;&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 39 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

These fantasy worlds were part of a general trend.  This era began a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ManloveP210-212&quot;&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' pp 210-212 ISBN 0-268-00790-X&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significiance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.  In ''Phantastes'', for instance, George MacDonald has a mentor-figure explain to the hero that the moral laws are the same in the world he is about to enter as in the world he came from; this lends weight and importance to his actions in this world, however fantastical it is.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 182 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] (in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Grey]]'') also developed fantasy, in the telling of horror tales,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 98-9 ISBN 0-253-17461-9&lt;/ref&gt;  a separate branch of fantasy that was to have great influence on [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and other writers of [[dark fantasy]].

Despite MacDonald's future influence, and Morris' popularity at the time, it was not until the turn of the century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience, with authors such as [[Lord Dunsany]] who, following Morris's example, wrote fantasy novels, but also in the short story form.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarterP2&quot;/&gt;  He was particularly noted for his vivid and evocative style.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarterP2&quot;/&gt;  His style greatly influenced many writers, not always happily; [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], in her essay on style in fantasy &quot;From Elfland to Poughkeepsie&quot;, wryly referred to Lord Dunsany as the &quot;First Terrible Fate that Awaiteth Unwary Beginners in Fantasy&quot;, alluding to young writers attempting to write in Lord Dunsany's style.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin, &quot;From Elfland to Poughkeepsie&quot;, p 78-9 ''The Language of the Night'' ISBN 0-425-05205-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Rider Haggard]] developed the conventions of the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] sub-genre, which sometime included fantasy works as in Haggard's own ''[[She (novel)|She]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarterP64&quot;&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Realms of Wizardry'' p 64 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  With Africa still largely unknown to European writers, it offered scope to this type.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarterP64&quot;/&gt;  Other writers, including [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Abraham Merritt]], built on the convention.

[[File:Dorothy and the Scarecrow 1900.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration from first edition of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'']]
Several classic [[juvenile fantasy|children's fantasies]] such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Pfeiffer]], &quot;Lewis Carroll&quot;, p 247-54, in [[E. F. Bleiler]],
''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror''.Scribner's,New York, 1985 ISBN 0-684-17808-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan]]'', [[L.Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', as well as the work of [[E. Nesbit]] and
[[Frank R. Stockton]] were also published around this time.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'',p 70-3, Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005.  ISBN 0-8108-6829-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, [[C.S. Lewis]] noted that in the earlier part of the 20th century, fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature, and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote in it to find an audience, despite concepts that could form an adult work.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, &quot;On Juvenile Tastes&quot;, p 41, ''Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories'', ISBN 0-15-667897-7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E.R. Eddison]], another influential writer, wrote near the end of this era.  He drew inspiration from Northern sagas, as Morris did, but his prose style was modeled more on Tudor and Elizabethan English, and his stories were filled with vigorous characters in glorious adventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin Carter p 39&quot;/&gt;  His characters were often of great ability and noble, if not royal, birth.  These characters have been admired for his work in making his villains, particularly, more vivid characters than Tolkien's.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 47 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have observed that while it is historically accurate to depict the great of the world trampling on the lower classes, his characters often treat their subjects with arrogance and insolence, and this is depicted as part of their greatness.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 132-3 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, at the end of ''[[The Worm Ouroboros]]'', the heroes, finding peace dull, pray for and get the revival of their enemies, so that they may go and fight them again, regardless of the casualties that such a war would have.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 116 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the terminology for the genre was not settled.  Many fantasies in this era were termed [[fairy tale]]s, including [[Max Beerbohm]]'s ''[[The Happy Hypocrite]]'' and MacDonald's ''Phantastes''.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Irwin, ''The Game of the Impossible'', p 92-3, University of Illinois Press, Urbana Chicago London, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  The name &quot;fantasy&quot; was not developed until later; as late as J.R.R. Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the term &quot;fairy tale&quot; was still being used.

=== Modern fantasy ===
A important factor in the development of the fantasy genre was the arrival of magazines devoted to fantasy fiction. The first
such publication was the German magazine ''[[Der Orchideengarten]]'' which ran from 1919-1921.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Orchideengarten, Der&quot;.
in: M.B. Tymn and [[Mike Ashley]], ''Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines''. Westport: Greenwood, 1985. pp. 866.
ISBN 0-313-21221-X&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1923 the first English-language fantasy fiction magazine, ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was created.&lt;ref&gt;''The  Weird Tales Story;;
by [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]]. Wildside Press,1999. ISBN 1-58715-101-4&lt;/ref&gt; Many other similar magazines eventually followed, most noticeably ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' (AKA ''Unknown Worlds'')&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unknown&quot;. in: M.B. Tymn and Mike Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines. Westport: Greenwood, 1985. pp.694-698. ISBN 0-313-21221-X&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''. The pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity at this time and  was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U.S. and Britain. Such magazines also played a large role in the rise of [[science fiction]] and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other.
[[File:Weird Tales 1935-11 - Shadows in Zamboula.jpg|thumb|''Weird Tales'' published works by such authors as Robert E Howard]]
Several of the genre's most prominent authors began their careers in these magazines including [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Ray Bradbury]] and most noticeably [[H. P. Lovecraft]].  Lovecraft was deeply influenced by Edgar Allan Poe and to a somewhat lesser extent, by Lord Dunsany;  with his [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories, he became one of the most influential writers of fantasy and horror in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 79 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of many [[Sword and Sorcery]] authors such as [[Robert E. Howard]] also began at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hoffman (writer)|Charles Hoffman]], &quot;Robert E. Howard: Twentieth Century Mythmaker&quot;, in''The Best of Robert E. Howard, Vol. 1, Crimson Shadows.'' Del Rey, 2007 pp. 473-84,
 ISBN 0-345-49018-5 .&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1950, sword and sorcery had begun to find a wide audience, with the success of Howard's [[Conan the Barbarian]], and [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] stories.  Howard's works, especially Conan, were to have a noteworthy, even defining, influence on the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 47-8, 0-689-10846-X&lt;/ref&gt;  They were tales of vivid, larger-than-life action and adventure,&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Realms of Wizardry'' p 146 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and after the work of Tolkien, the most widely read works of fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 135 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Leiber's stories were particularly noted for their uncommon realism for the time; ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' developed this trait, with many stories in it showing credibility and realism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, ''Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy'' p 50 ISBN 1-932265-07-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Morris and Eddison before him, Leiber continued the tradition of drawing on Northern European legend and folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 85 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  [[C.L. Moore]] was among Howard's first imitators, with &quot;The Black God's Kiss&quot;, in which she introduced [[Jirel of Joiry]] and the heroine protagonist to sword and sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Realms of Wizardry'' p 205 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the pulp magazines, several American writers used the medium of fantasy for [[humorous]] and [[satirical]] purposes, including [[James Branch Cabell]] (whose 1919 novel ''[[Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice|Jurgen]]'' became the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution
for [[obscenity]]),&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stableford, ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'',p 58-9, Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005.  ISBN 0-8108-6829-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorne Smith]], with ''Topper'' (1926) and ''Turnabout'' (1931), and [[Charles G. Finney]], author of
''[[The Circus of Dr. Lao]]'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary K. Wolfe]], &quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot;, p 282-6, in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 1. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983. ISBN 0-89356-450-8 .&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, with the publication of ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]'', [[T. H. White]] introduced one of the most notable works of [[comic fantasy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 121-2 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  This strain continued with such writers as [[L. Sprague de Camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 136 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary critics of the era began to take an interest in &quot;fantasy&quot; as a genre of writing,
and also to argue that it was an genre worthy of serious consideration.
[[Herbert Read]] devoted a chapter of his book ''English Prose Style'' (1928) to discussing &quot;Fantasy&quot; as a mode of 
writing, arguing it was unjustly considered suitable only for children: &quot;The Western World does not seem to have conceived the necessity of Fairy Tales for Grown-Ups&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;scholes&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Wagenknecht]] also discussed fantasy as an aspect of
literature in his 1946 article &quot;The Little Prince Rides the White Deer&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Edward Wagenknecht, &quot;The Little Prince Rides the White Deer: Fantasy and Symbolism in Recent Literature&quot;, ''College English'' 7(8): 431-437. May 1946. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Tolkien===
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|&quot;Creation of the Two Trees&quot; from Tolkien's work]]
However, it was the advent of high fantasy and, most importantly, the popularity of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' which finally allowed fantasy to truly enter into the mainstream. Tolkien had published ''The Hobbit'' in 1937 and ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the 1950s; while the first was a juvenile fantasy, the second was an [[epic fantasy]] of great scope and seriousness.&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 196 Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]],&quot;Tolkien, J(ohn) R(onald), R(euel)&quot;, ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed.
[[David Pringle]], St. James Press, 1996, ISBN 1-55862-205-5, pp 558-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tolkien's works had been successful in Britain, it was not until the late 1960s that they finally became popular in America; however, at that point they began to sell steadily and in large numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shippey&quot;&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' pp xx-xxi, ISBN 0-618-25759-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous polls to identify the greatest book of the century found ''The Lord of the Rings'' selected by widely different groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shippey&quot;/&gt;

It is difficult to overstate the impact that ''The Lord of the Rings'' had on the fantasy genre; in some respects, it swamped all the works of fantasy that had been written before it, and it unquestionably created &quot;fantasy&quot; as a marketing category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yolen&quot;&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], &quot;Introduction&quot; p vii-viii in ''After the King:  Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed., [[Martin H. Greenberg]], ISBN 0-312-85175-8&lt;/ref&gt;  It created an enormous number of [[Tolkienesque]] works, using the themes found in ''The Lord of the Rings''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yolen&quot;/&gt;

While fantasists had created [[fantasy world]]s from the time of William Morris, Tolkien's influence enormously boosted them, with a decline of such devices as [[Dream world (plot device)|dream frame]]s to explain away the fantastical nature of the setting.  This stemmed not only from his example, but from his literary criticism; his &quot;[[On Fairy Stories]]&quot;, in which he termed such settings &quot;secondary worlds,&quot; was a formative work of fantasy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Tolkien, J(ohn) R(onald) R(euel)&quot;, p 951 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact that his books, combined with the success of several other series such as [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', [[Mervyn Peake]]'s ''[[Gormenghast series]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]],,&quot;Peake, Mervyn (Laurence)&quot;, ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed. David Pringle, St. James Press, 1996, ISBN 1-55862-205-5, pp. 469-70&lt;/ref&gt; and Ursula K. Le Guin's ''[[Earthsea]]'', helped cement the genre's popularity and gave birth to the current wave of fantasy literature.

=== Post-Tolkien fantasy ===

{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}

With the immense success of Tolkien's works many publishers began to search for a new series which could have similar mass-market appeal. For the first time publishing fantasy was looked at as a profitable business venture and fantasy novels began to replace the fiction magazines as the heart of the genre.

[[Lin Carter]] edited the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]], when Ballantine pursued the fantasy market; it was so titled to avert its being filed as children's literature.  The line contained mostly reprints, but also introduced some new fantasy works. The series included works of [[William Morris]], [[Lord Dunsany]], and [[George MacDonald]], and other works:  [[Hope Mirrlees]]'s ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'', [[Ernest Bramah]]'s [[Kai Lung]] books, and most influential of all, [[Evangeline Walton]]'s ''[[The Island of the Mighty]]'', the success of which led to the publication of the other three novels she had written in that series, and to a distinct strain of [[Celtic fantasy]] in later fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', &quot;Ballantine Adult Fantasy series&quot; p 82, ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Another work in this series that was influential for the Celtic fantasy subgenre was [[Katherine Kurtz]]'s ''[[Deryni Rising]]''.

Although many fantasy novels of this time proved popular, it was not until 1977's ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]'' that publishers found the sort of breakthrough success they had hoped for. The book became the first fantasy novel to appear on, and eventually top the [[New York Times bestseller list]]. As a result the genre saw an incredible boom in the number of titles published in the following years. Notable fantasy
novels of the late 1970s and 1980s included [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''Lord Foul's Bane'' (1977) the first in
''[[The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever]]'' series, [[John Crowley]]'s ''[[Little, Big]]'' (1981), [[Robert Holdstock]]'s ''[[Mythago Wood]]'' (1984) and [[Glen Cook|Glen Cook's]] [[Black Company]] series.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Mathews]],''Fantasy: The Liberation of Imagination''.Routledge, 2002, p.35 ISBN 0-415-93890-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These books are notable for their attempts to break out of the Tolkienian notion of fantasy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Notable books of the 1990s include [[Robert Jordan|Robert Jordan's]] popular series ''[[Wheel of Time]]'', [[Tad Williams|Tad Williams']] ''[[Memory, Sorrow and Thorn]]'' series and [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'' (part of the series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;AShortHistoryofFantasy&quot;&gt;Farah Mendlesohn, ''A Short History of Fantasy'', ISBN 978-1-904750-68-0&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Game Of Thrones'' is considered a path-breaking work which paved the work for a new kind of fantasy, which was less idealistic and more violent in nature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

While fantasy has remained somewhat of a niche market, that has begun to change in recent years. The long-running series of light fantasies by [[Piers Anthony]] ([[Xanth]]) and [[Terry Pratchett]] ([[Discworld]]) regularly hit the bestseller lists from the 1980s onward. Thanks largely to [[J.K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter novels]], which have become the best selling book series of all time, fantasy is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream fiction. The blockbuster success of several [[film adaptation]]s of fantasy novels such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' has helped further this trend.

Another recent trend in fantasy is the popularity of female-centric urban fantasy, very different from Tolkien's works, as shown by the popularity of [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s [[twilight (series)|''Twilight'' series]] and  [[Charlaine Harris|Charlaine Harris']] ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'' books.&lt;ref name=&quot;secrethistoryreview&quot;&gt;[http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2011/04/the_secret_hist.shtml The Secret History of Fantasy, edited by Peter S. Beagle (Reviewed by Chris Kammerud)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today fantasy continues as an expansive, multi-layered medium encompassing many sub-genres of literature; from traditional [[high fantasy]] and [[sword and sorcery]], to [[magical realism]], [[fairytale fantasy]], horror-tinged [[dark fantasy]] and more.

In various [[fantasy]] games and other fiction as well as in [[occult]]ism, the term '''Chaos Energy''' describes some sort of [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[energy]].

In some [[fictional universe]]s, it can be found solidified in the form of stones. Examples include
* [[Chaos Emerald]]s, found in the Special Zone in the world of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog series|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[video game]]s and [[comic]]s,
* [[Warpstone]] (or “Wyrdstone”), a greenish-black [[crystal]] found in the ''[[Warhammer Fantasy (setting)|Warhammer]]'' world,   and possibly others.

==Literal==
For some real-world [[Esotericism|esotericists]], chaos energy is negative and destructive, so it opposes positive, life-supporting energy. It is supposed to be emitted by man-made objects (electromagnetic pollution would then be one example). For others, it just opposes Order without especially negative connotations.
Most think of it as the energy generated by all conflicting forces such as ''life energy'' (the energy that sustains life) and ''death energy'' (the energy that cancels life out). Also, on occasion, Chaos Energy is referenced as a mix of the energies of light and darkness. Generally, however, this product energy is more destructive and dark.

Chaos energy is frequently described as self-feeding, growing and growing until stopped. Its effect on the minds of most living things, physical or not, is usually very detrimental, resulting in madness, anger, and other harsh emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-sites.tripod.com/All_about_chaos.htm#generalkaoinfo http://alt-sites.tripod.com/All_about_chaos.htm#generalkaoinfo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
While chaos in itself is a theoretically uncontrollable energy, it is said to be able to be controlled by use of iron or even steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-sites.tripod.com/All_about_chaos.htm#8waykao http://alt-sites.tripod.com/All_about_chaos.htm#8waykao]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most use of chaos energy is frowned upon by the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[psionic]] community. Those who attempt to control chaos energy with a variety of methods, mainly the 'iron' method, are treated as unstable, [[insane]], or reckless.

[[Image:Dorsai filking conclave30.jpg|thumb|right|Filking at [[ConClave (convention)|ConClave]] 30.]]
'''Filk''' is a musical culture, genre, and community tied to [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction/fantasy fandom]] and a type of [[fan labor]]. The genre has been active since the early 1950s, and played primarily since the mid-1970s. The term (originally a [[typographical error]]) predates 1955.&lt;ref name = &quot;Coppa in Hellekson and Busse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and definitions==
As the Interfilk ''What Is Filk'' page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/filk.htm What Is Filk]&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates, there is no consensus definition of filk.  Attempts have been made to define filk based on various criteria.

===Style and content===
Filk has been defined as [[folk music]], usually with a [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] theme, but this definition is not exact. '''Filkers''' have been known to write filk songs about a variety of topics, including but not limited to tangentially related topics such as computers and cats.  In addition, while the majority of filk songs are in the folk style, other styles such as [[blues]], [[calypso music|calypso]], and even [[rock music|rock]] periodically appear.

===Performer===
Filk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at [[science fiction conventions|science fiction/fantasy conventions]].  This definition might be summarized as, &quot;I can't define it, but I can point at it.&quot;

=== Sociology ===
Yet another definition focuses on filking as a community of those interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self-identified with filking. As described later in this article, the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social-network aspect of filking.  The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the &quot;performer vs. audience&quot; dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Barry and Sally Childs-Helton|Dr. Sally Childs-Helton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filkontario.ca/hof/hoftribe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever definition one chooses, filk is a form of [[music]] created from within [[science fiction fandom|science fiction and fantasy fandom]], often performed late at night at science fiction conventions, though there are now dedicated filk conventions in Canada, England, Germany, and the USA.  Whichever definition one chooses, the boundaries of filking are muddy. For example, filking overlaps with the singing and music performed by participants in the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] or at [[LARP]]s.

=== Verb ===
The word &quot;filk&quot; has also evolved as a verb, with two common meanings:
# To participate in a filk song [[Filk music#Filk Circle|circle]], as in, &quot;we were filking last night until three in the morning.&quot;
# To write a filk music [[Parody music|parody]] of an existing song, as in, &quot;I filked 'Hope Eyrie'.&quot; It's important to note that &quot;filk&quot;, when used in this way, does not imply that all song parodies are considered filk music, nor does it imply that all filk songs are parodies.  Besides, setting satirical or parody lyrics to established tunes is not exclusively the province of SF/fantasy fandom. [[Parody music]] such as that found in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' or performed by [[Weird Al Yankovic]] has its own long-established traditions and history.

==Styles and subjects==
In keeping with the folk-culture roots of filk, the musical styles and topics of filk music are eclectic. While a plurality of filk is rooted firmly in acoustic-instrument folk music, other pieces and artists draw inspiration from [[Rock (music)|rock]], [[a cappella]] vocal groups, or other styles. The hobbyist and itinerant nature of filk events (especially filk circles) gives some advantages to acoustic-vocal soloists and small groups, who need only carry a lightweight instrument or two and whose rehearsals do not need to balance scheduling logistics against regular work and other obligations. One of the few rock-style groups in filk has been [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]], whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock.  Some styles of filk rely heavily on sampling the original source material and integrating it in to electronica and hip-hop music such as [[76 (band)|76]]'s &quot;Objects in Space&quot; which is an homage to the popular TV show [[Firefly (TV series)|''Firefly'']] and [[DJ Qbert]]'s ''[[Wave Twisters]].''

The range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom. Many songs honor specific works in science fiction, fantasy, or speculative fiction. Other songs are about science, fantasy, computers, technology in general, or values related to technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/09/68697 Xeni Jardin, &quot;Filk Music for Nerd People&quot;, ''Wired'', 2005-09-01]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet others are about the culture of fandom, including filk itself (both as a phenomenon within fandom, and as a sub-culture). Many filk songs (such as [[Leslie Fish]]'s &quot;[[Carmen Miranda]]'s Ghost Is Haunting Space Station 3&quot;) are humorous while others treat their subjects seriously (like Steve Macdonald's &quot;Journey's Done&quot;).

However, some common themes do not fall neatly into filk's science fiction origins. Such topics include songs about cats, popular culture, and politics. These are perhaps best explained as an outgrowth of filk as a folk culture, open in some respects to expansion by individual artists.

A significant number of filk songs are [[Parody music|parodies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Bragg |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |title=Filk: Sci-fi meets folk music |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music/Filk_Sci-fi_meets_folk_music_98699099.html?showFullArticle=y |date=July 18, 2010 |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are parodies of songs from popular culture, others are parodies of existing filk songs. Although parody is not the primary focus of the filk music culture, the number of parody songs found in filk is higher than in other musical cultures.  Another subtype of filk songs is the &quot;ose&quot; song, one on themes of death and gloom.  The term derives from the word &quot;morose&quot;, as in &quot;ose, morose, even-more-ose.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[Roberta Rogow, &quot;Futurespeak&quot;, p. 238.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A further variant is &quot;cheeri-ose&quot;, ose songs to cheery tunes, or treating the same subject lightheartedly.  Cf. [[Tom Lehrer]], &quot;The Irish Ballad&quot;.

==History==
For the first few decades of the occasional [[science fiction convention]], there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms. Part of this practice may have been rooted in an older folk culture of fans. Some of the oldest filks coming out of fandom were protest songs with original words and music written by a group of New York fans called [[Futurians|The Futurians]], and were written by [[Fred Pohl]] and [[Cyril Kornbluth]] (see [[Damon Knight]]'s book of the same name, which contains the words and music to several of them). With the break up of the city clubs common during the depression, filking moved to science fiction conventions, often in the form of late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms, lobbies, service passages, or wherever else the filkers could find enough room to play/sing music uninterrupted.

In the early 1950s, the term ''filk music'' started as a misspelling of ''folk music'' in an essay by Lee Jacobs, &quot;The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music&quot;. Wrai Ballard, then editor of the Spectator [[amateur press association|Amateur Press Society]] refused to publish it for fear that the article's bawdy content could get them into trouble with the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Post Office]] under the [[Comstock Laws]], but found the typo itself amusing, and mentioned it repeatedly;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Gold|Gold, Lee]]. &quot;An Egocentric and Convoluted History of Early 'Filk' And Filking. ''[[ConChord]] 12 Songbook'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; thus,  Jacobs' typo became the self-identified term for the genre/subculture while it was still an informal, unrecognized activity at conventions.  Its first documented deliberate use was by [[Karen Kruse Anderson]] in ''Die Zeitschrift für vollständigen Unsinn'' (''The Journal for Utter Nonsense'') #774 (June 1953), for a song written by her husband [[Poul Anderson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;firstUse&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.nightsong.com/filk/twippledop/ |title=Tracking Down The First Deliberate Use Of &quot;Filk Song&quot; |accessdate=2006-11-25 |first= Lee |last=Gold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s also saw the first formal publication of filksongs, generally as lyric sheets, but occasionally complete with (often original) music.  While many of those original songs faded into obscurity, some continued to be popular for decades.  By the late 1970s, periodicals such as ''Kantele'' and ''Philk Fee-Nom-Ee-Non'' offered a ready outlet for filk writers.

At the 1974 [[World Science Fiction Convention]] author [[Robert Asprin|Bob Asprin]] announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars, and a singing session ensued later that night.&lt;ref name=&quot;dorsaiHistory&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.di.org/di_f_his.htm |title=Filk Music and the Dorsai Irregulars |accessdate=2006-11-25 |author=John Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions. Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers, or filking occurred in hallways, bars or any other place that the filkers could find. Some convention organizers in the 1980s began inviting guests specifically for their filking. Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk, beginning with FilkCon in [[Chicago]] in 1979, organized by [http://www.filkontario.ca/1997.htm#middle Margaret Middleton] and Curt Clemmer, later joined by BayFilk in Northern California; the [[Ohio Valley Filk Fest]] (OVFF) in Columbus, Ohio; ConChord in [[Los Angeles]], California; Musicon in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[FilKONtario]] near [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]; a [http://www.contabile.org.uk/ rotating British filkcon]; the German [http://www.filkcontinental.de/ FilkCONtinental]; and others.

These efforts grew to raising funds for traveling filkers. The first was a British Filk Fund and then, in the early 1990s, several active organizers in North America [http://www.interfilk.org/interfilk/back.htm created Interfilk], which is now the most active traveling filker fund. Beginning with British filker Mike Whitaker in 1992, 40&amp;nbsp;filkers were the beneficiaries of [http://www.interfilk.org/ Interfilk] subsidies in its first decade. OVFF began presenting the [[Pegasus Award]] annually for excellence in filk in 1984, and [http://www.filkontario.ca FilkOntario] started the [http://www.filkontario.ca/HallofFame.htm Filk Hall of Fame] in 1995, honoring contributions to the community as well as to the music.

After years of amateur tape recordings made at filksings, a trickle of studio-produced albums and tapes began to arrive in the 1970s.  These included ''[[Folk Songs for Folk Who Ain't Been Yet]]'' (featuring Leslie Fish and friends) and ''Children of the Future'' by Karen Willson.

[[Off Centaur Publications]] was one of the first formal attempts to regularly produce and promote filk albums, followed by many others since. As the costs of amateur album production dropped in the 1990s, more filkers created albums and, more recently, audio files available for downloading online.

E-mail and the internet have also fostered the networking of self-identified filkers. In the late 1980s, California filker Kay Shapero created the filk group on the [[Fidonet]] hobbyist network of electronic bulletin boards. The later creation of other electronic forums — the Usenet group rec.music.filk, a United Kingdom e-mail list [http://lists.filklore.co.uk/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/filk_uk FILK_UK] and the [http://filk.info/filklist/ German language list], an [http://www.filknet.org/irc.html IRC channel] devoted to filking, and a growing cluster of filkers blogging on [[LiveJournal]] (including a LiveJournal [http://community.livejournal.com/filk/ community]), to pick a few examples — have mirrored the growing connections among other self-identified social networks (or subcultures). The availability of several hundred albums labeled filk, the proliferation of specialty filk conventions, and the continued growth of electronic means for community connections have led to an intensification of community building. A few years into the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, filking as an identifiable community exists on at least three continents.

On the album ''Precious Friend'', [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] perform &quot;Old Time Religion&quot;, in a filk version.  Most of the verses of this version were by [[Gordon Dickson]]; when Seeger finally discovered this, after the album was issued, he sent royalties on to Dickson.

== Filk Circle ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Filk music is most commonly performed in a gathering known as a ''Filk Circle''. Similar to the [[drum circle|Drum Circles]] and Bardic Circles found at [[society for creative anachronism|SCA]] events and other [[science fiction fandom|fannish]] events, filk circles can be formed in any location where filkers gather.

Filk circles are different from concert-style musical performances. Although filk music can also be performed in front of an audience, and there are concerts scheduled at filk conventions and science fiction conventions worldwide, filk circles are a more common occurrence. The purpose of a filk circle is for musicians to share songs with other musicians, so performing and listening are given equal emphasis. In a filk circle, there is no stage, there is no audience. Those who participate in a filk circle may choose to perform, to listen, or both, as the mood strikes them. Performers may know only one song, or they may have an extensive library of songs from which to choose. Participants are usually encouraged to join in and sing along or play along on their instruments.

Filk circles can be formalized parts of larger events, such as being assigned a specific time and location on the schedule of a science fiction convention, or they can be completely informal and spontaneous, forming organically in hotel hallways and lobbies. Filk-specific conventions will usually have multiple filk circles happening simultaneously in different rooms, with some circles focused on a single style or topic. Local parties called ''housefilks'' are day-long events organized around a single filk circle held in the host's home.

As the name implies, a rough circle of chairs is usually formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  The details depend on the available space and furniture, and it may not even end up being circular, or even have chairs at all. The purpose of the circular formation is both symbolic and functional: By having everyone face each other, it honors all participants as equals, it emphasizes both listening and performing, and it makes each participant visible to every other participant.

A formally organized filk circle can have the chairs set up ahead of time, with the organizers estimating the number of participants and adjusting the size of the circle as best they can. A circle that is too large for the number of participants tends to feel uncomfortably empty, but a circle that is too small will need to be enlarged as the number of participants grows. The disruption that results from attempting to enlarge a filk circle in progress can break up the flow of the songs and change the mood, so enlarging the circle is often avoided in favor of adding extra layers (concentric circles) outside the inner circle (space permitting).

=== Time of day ===
Traditionally, filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  Of course, this depends upon the location, the participants, and the organizers. Filk circles have been known to continue all night, or at least into the early morning hours. Those organizing formal filk circles at conventions usually make arrangements with the hotel for the space to be available for the entire night. There are many exceptions to this; it's not uncommon to find a housefilk scheduled to start in the early afternoon and end in the early evening, for example.

=== Musical instruments ===
At most filk circles, the participants are expected to bring their own musical instruments (if they play an instrument at all), although sometimes you will find organizers or performers bringing a collection of extra instruments so that others may borrow or experiment with them. Most performers who bring instruments such as guitars are usually happy to loan their instruments to someone who comes to the circle without one.

A wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle, although the most common is the [[acoustic guitar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bragg&quot;/&gt;  Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments, although portable [[electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and even [[theremin]]s are not unheard of.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Small, easily portable instruments are more common than large ones, although larger items such as small [[drum kit]]s and [[double bass|upright basses]] can be found at some filk circles. A large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and Celtic instruments such as [[fiddle]]s, [[mandolin]]s, [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[banjo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[recorder]]s, [[bodhran|bodhráns]], [[bongo drum|bongos]] and [[goblet drum|darbukas]].

=== Song presentation ===
Songs are presented very informally. They can be given with spoken introductions and explanations, or they can be simply played and allowed to speak for themselves. Songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme, or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood. Songs can be performed by individuals, duos, groups, or groups hastily assembled from other participants. Songs can be accompanied by instruments or be performed [[a cappella]]. Songs can be original songs, [[cover version|covers]], [[parody music|parodies]], [[instrumental]]s, or even spoken-word pieces such as poetry and stories.

An active and well-attended filk circle, at its peak, will usually be a somewhat continuous stream of songs, with only a small amount of conversation between songs. Filk circles that are just getting started or winding down may have more talking and socializing than music.

=== Types ===
[[Image:Sfcon-music-session-ddb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Filk circle)]]
Filk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it's time to perform or time to listen to other performers. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the most common types of filk circle are listed below.

====Bardic====
In a bardic circle, each person in the circle (as well as those sitting in concentric circles around the inner circle, if any), go in turns, with each turn moving sequentially either clockwise or counterclockwise around the circle. Each participant is given the choice of ''pick, pass, or play''. &quot;Pick&quot; means they can request a specific song, a specific performer, a general topic or style, or any other similar request from an individual or from the circle in general. &quot;Pass&quot; means they skip their turn and the choice passes on to the next person in sequence. &quot;Play&quot; means they can perform any song they choose, either specific to the current topic or mood, or deliberately different from the current topic or mood.

The advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure which enforces politeness. It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn, so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform. There are disadvantages, however. A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle, making people wait too long for their turn. There is less spontaneity in a bardic circle than a chaos circle, and the chance of being able to play a good &quot;follower&quot; song is reduced.

====Chaos====
In a chaos circle, there is no sequential organization. Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished, or any participant can shout out a request. Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time. Frequently the word &quot;follower!&quot; is shouted in a chaos circle, meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song, and they want to play it now.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;&gt;Gold, Lee; http://www.kayshapero.net/filkcirc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaos circle's advantage is its spontaneity and energy. &quot;Runs&quot; of songs will frequently get started, with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song's topic. The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort be polite and respectful in a chaos circle: It's easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who's trying to start up a song of their own, especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room. Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold, loud performers who can command attention.

====Token Bardic====
A token bardic circle, also known as a &quot;poker-chip&quot; bardic circle, attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle. A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle. Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room (frequently two tokens), and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn (see ''Bardic'', above). When all the active tokens in the circle are used up, they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold&quot;/&gt;

The advantage of a token bardic is that there's still a chance for spontaneity and followers, yet it's easy to be polite to other performers because you can easily see when another performer wants a turn. The disadvantage is that, like bardic, in a large circle it may take a long time for you to get another turn after you've used up your existing turns.

There are variations of these styles, some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator. A given circle can change its style mid-stream, if the participants agree. It's common to see the participants of a bardic circle &quot;go chaos&quot; or vice versa, for example.

=== Etiquette ===
The etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music, including (and perhaps especially) amateur music and amateur performers. Everyone is encouraged to perform, regardless of their skill level. No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions.

Although singing along and playing along with instruments (including improvisation) is usually encouraged, filk circles are not like [[jam session]]s. Jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously, whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn. Singing along and playing along are expected to be done politely, contributing to the song rather than overshadowing the song's performer. The exception to this rule is when a jam session is specifically scheduled at a filk convention.

Disruptions and distractions are discouraged during a song. This includes walking through the circle, general noise, and conversations. If between-song conversations and noise get out of hand, it's common to hear someone shout, &quot;filker up!&quot; as a signal to end the conversations so that the next person can have their turn.

==Cultural perspective==
There are several shared values that come from the cultural creation of filk in a social network, even one that spans several continents.

At a deep level, the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture. When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2003, ethnomusicologist Sally Childs-Helton said, ''We have taken our right to be creative and to literally &quot;play&quot; in the best sense of that word.'' Filk combines folk roots, live music circles, and dominant acoustical instrumentation, on the one hand, with high-tech cultural maintenance, on the other hand—a dense network of filkers' web pages, recordings, sound reinforcement at filk conventions, e-mail lists, and so on. The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity, especially in connection with technology. (See for example Leslie Fish's [http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/hope-eyrie.html Hope Eyrie].) While there are significant numbers of memorial songs (e.g., Launius, 2004), pessimistic songs blame carelessness, incompetence, and corruption, only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future. Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk, they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis-a-vis technology (in contrast to Nye, 1996).

Within the community, the folk culture of filk acknowledges the legitimacy of music created by artists with a broad range of skills. Those who actively identify themselves as filkers include professional musicians, musical novices, and all ranges in between. The repeat appearances of professional musicians at filk-specific conventions suggests a certain amount of respect given high levels of musical skill within filking, even while the culture is open to less experienced musicians. Whether the occasion is a '''housefilk''' in someone's home or a convention (festival) over a weekend, filk culture encourages respectful listening regardless of the performers' skill level and manifest opportunities for participation from single songs in a musical circle to scheduled concerts.

That openness to participation is a marked norm in filking (e.g., Jenkins, 1992) and makes it relatively unique in a larger society that glorifies competition and super-stardom in performance arts.  Mentorship within the filk community includes formal workshops at conventions as well as the informal swapping of advice in various forums.

Occasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community. Newsgroup debates over such topics as [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.filk/browse_thread/thread/27e133d9408370ba/ca2d4f0a1b157027?lnk=st&amp;q=filk+'weird+al'&amp;rnum=3&amp;hl=en#ca2d4f0a1b157027 whether 'Weird Al' Yankovic is a filker] suggest the deep feelings involved. In practice, most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self-identified filk events, not to professional artists whose work may be considered '''found filk'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm |title=Acceptance Speeches of Barry &amp; Sally Childs-Helton |accessdate=2007-11-29 |last=Childs-Helton |first=Barry |coauthors=Sally Childs-Helton |date=2003-03-29 |work=Filk Hall of Fame |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071023190656/http://www.filkontario.ca/BSCHspeeches.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jenkins | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Jenkins | coauthors = | title = Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = New York | pages = | chapter = 'Strangers No More We Sing': Filk Music, Folk Culture, and the Fan Community | url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-415-90571-0 | oclc = 26055104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Roger D. | last=Launius| coauthors=| contribution=Got Filk?

==Pegasus Awards== &lt;!-- [[Pegasus Award]] and [[Pegasus award]] redirect to this section --&gt;
The '''Pegasus Awards''' were founded to recognize and honor excellence in filking. These awards are given annually at the Ohio Valley Filk Fest (or OVFF). Anyone with an interest in filk can nominate songs or individuals for the awards, and anyone can vote. It is not necessary to be a member of the convention to be involved in the nomination and voting process.

Currently awards are given in six categories: Best Song, Best Performer, Best Writer/Composer, Best Classic Song and two topical categories that vary from year to year. Some examples of past categories include: Best Love Song, Best Literature Song, Best Techie Song, Best Sing Along, etc.

The OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for Finalists for the Pegasus Awards (the Nominating Ballot) during the late spring and summer. There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the Nominating Ballot. The Finalist Ballot is distributed in the early fall, and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF. Voting can be done online—either to nominate Finalists, or to vote for the Finalists themselves. The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself, where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert. The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/index.html Pegasus Awards site]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dobryna.jpg|right|thumb|Fairy tales and legends, such as [[Dobrynya Nikitich]]'s rescue of Zabava Putyatichna from the dragon [[Gorynych]], have been an important source for fantasy.]]

{{Fantasy}}

'''Fantasy''' is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] that commonly uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other [[supernatural]] phenomena as a primary element of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], or [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. Many works within the genre take place in [[imaginary world]]s where magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and [[macabre]] themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of [[speculative fiction]].

In [[popular culture]], the genre of fantasy is dominated by its [[Medievalism|medievalist]] form, especially since the worldwide success of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and related books by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Fantasy has also included [[fairy tale]]s, [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]s, [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerers]], or [[witchcraft]], (etc.), in events which avoid horror. In its broadest sense, however, fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.

Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines ([[English language|English]], [[cultural studies]], [[comparative literature]], [[history]], [[medieval studies]]). Work in this area ranges widely, from the structuralist theory of [[Tzvetan Todorov]], which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Tolmie, &quot;Medievalism and the Fantasy Heroine&quot;, ''[[Journal of Gender Studies]]'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (July 2006), pp. 145–158. ISSN 0958-9236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits of fantasy==

The identifying traits of fantasy are the inclusion of fantastic elements in a self-coherent (internally [[consistent]]) setting, where inspiration from mythology and [[folklore]] remains a consistent theme.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Grant (science fiction writer)|John Grant]] and [[John Clute]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', &quot;Fantasy&quot;, p 338 ISBN 0-312-19869-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Within such a structure, any location of the fantastical element is possible:  it may be hidden in, or leak into the apparently real world setting, it may draw the characters into a world with such elements, or it may occur entirely in a [[fantasy world]] setting, where such elements are part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Langton, &quot;The Weak Place in the Cloth&quot; p163-180, ''Fantasists on Fantasy'', ed. Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, ISBN 0-380-86553-X&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, fantasy follows rules of its own making, allowing magic and other fantastic devices to be used and still be internally cohesive.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 10, 0-689-10846-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}

{{details|History of fantasy}}

{{see also|Sources of fantasy}}

Beginning perhaps with the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the earliest written documents known to humankind, mythic and other elements that would eventually come to define fantasy and its various subgenres have been a part of some of the grandest and most celebrated works of literature.  From ''[[The Odyssey]]'' to ''[[Beowulf]]'', from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' to ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'', from the ''[[Ramayana]]'' to the ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and from the [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]] and medieval [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]] to the [[epic poetry]] of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', fantastical adventures featuring brave [[hero]]es and [[heroine]]s, deadly [[monster]]s, and secret [[arcane]] [[realm]]s have inspired many audiences.  In this sense, the history of fantasy and the history of literature are inextricably intertwined.

[[File:The Enchanted Garden of Messer Ansaldo by Marie Spartali Stillman (1889).jpg|thumb|Many works are unclear as to the belief of the authors in the marvels they contain, as in the enchanted garden from the ''[[Decameron]]''.]]

There are many works where the boundary between fantasy and other works is not clear; the question of whether the writers believed in the possibilities of the marvels in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' or ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' makes it difficult to distinguish when fantasy, in its modern sense, first began.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', p 14, ISBN 0-253-35665-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (1841), the history of modern fantasy literature is usually said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the Scottish author of such novels as ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858), the latter of which is widely considered to be the first fantasy novel ever written for adults. MacDonald was a major influence on both [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]. The other major fantasy author of this era was [[William Morris]], a popular English poet who wrote several novels in the latter part of the century, including ''The Well at the World's End''.

Despite MacDonald's future influence with ''At the Back of the North Wind'' (1871), and Morris's popularity with his contemporaries, it wasn't until the 20th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience. [[Lord Dunsany]] established the genre's popularity in both the novel and the short story form. Many popular mainstream authors also began to write fantasy at this time, including [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Rudyard Kipling]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. These authors, along with [[Abraham Merritt]], established what was known as the &quot;lost world&quot; sub-genre, which was the most popular form of fantasy in the early decades of the 20th century, although several classic children's fantasies, such as ''[[Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', were also published around this time.

Indeed, [[juvenile fantasy]] was considered more acceptable than fantasy intended for adults, with the effect that writers who wished to write fantasy had to fit their work in a work for children.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, &quot;On Juvenile Tastes&quot;, p 41, ''Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories'', ISBN 0-15-667897-7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] wrote fantasy in a ''[[A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys]]'', intended for children &lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, p 62, ISBN 0-253-35665-2&lt;/ref&gt;, though works for adults only verged on fantasy.  For many years, this and successes such as ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1865), created the circular effect that all fantasy works, even the later ''The Lord of the Rings'', were therefore classified as children's literature.

In 1923 the first all-fantasy fiction magazine, ''[[Weird Tales]]'', was created. Many other similar magazines eventually followed, most noticeably ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]''. The pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity at this time and was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U.S. and Britain. Such magazines were also instrumental in the rise of [[science fiction]], and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other. 

By 1950 &quot;[[sword and sorcery]]&quot; fiction had begun to find a wide audience, with the success of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian]] and [[Fritz Leiber]]'s [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] stories.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p 135 ISBN 0-87054-076-9&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the advent of [[high fantasy]], and most of all J. R. R. Tolkien's ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' which reached new heights of popularity in the late 1960s, that allowed fantasy to truly enter the mainstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yolen&quot;&gt;Jane Yolen, &quot;Introduction&quot; p vii-viii ''After the King:  Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, ISBN 0-312-85175-8&lt;/ref&gt; Several other series, such as C. S. Lewis's ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea]] books, helped cement the genre's popularity.

The popularity of the fantasy genre has continued to increase in the 21st century, as evidenced by the best-selling statuses of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] series; [[Rick Riordan]]'s [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] pentalogy, which focuses on Greek mythology; [[The Kane Chronicles]] trilogy, which focuses on Egyptian mythology; and the [[Heroes of Olympus]] trilogy, which focuses on Greek and Roman mythology, along with all three's successors. Several fantasy film adaptations have achieved blockbuster status, most notably [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], and the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' films, currently one of the highest-grossing film series in film history.

Fantasy is a popular genre, having found a home for itself in almost every medium. While fantasy art and recently fantasy films have been increasingly popular, it is fantasy [[literature]] which has always been the genre's primary medium.

Fantasy [[role-playing game]]s cross several different media. The [[tabletop role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was the first and is the most successful and influential, and the [[science fantasy]] role-playing game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' has been an icon of the [[role-playing video game]] genre.

==Subgenres==

{{details|Fantasy subgenres}}

Modern fantasy, including early modern fantasy, has also spawned many new subgenres with no clear counterpart in mythology or folklore, although inspiration from mythology and folklore remains a consistent theme.  Fantasy subgenres are numerous and diverse, frequently overlapping with other forms of speculative fiction in almost every medium in which they are produced.  A couple of examples are the [[science fantasy]] and [[dark fantasy]] subgenres, which the fantasy genre shares with science fiction and horror, respectively.

==Subculture==

Professionals such as publishers, editors, authors, artists, and scholars within the fantasy genre get together yearly at the [[World Fantasy Convention]].  The [[World Fantasy Awards]] are presented at the convention. The first WFC was held in 1975, and it has occurred every year since. The convention is held at a different city each year. 

Additionally, many science fiction conventions, such as Florida's FX Show and [[MegaCon]], cater to fantasy and horror fans. [[Anime]] conventions, such as [[Ohayocon]] or [[Anime Expo]] frequently feature showings of fantasy, science fantasy, and dark fantasy series and films, such as ''[[Majutsushi Orphen]]'' (fantasy), ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' (urban fantasy), ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'' (dark fantasy), and ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (fantasy). Many science fiction/fantasy and anime conventions also strongly feature or cater to one or more of the several subcultures within the main subcultures, including the [[cosplay]] subculture (in which people make and/or wear costumes based on existing or self-created characters, sometimes also acting out skits or plays as well), the [[fan fiction]] subculture, and the fan video or [[anime music video|AMV]] subculture, as well as the large internet subculture devoted to reading and writing prose fiction and/or [[doujinshi]] in or related to those genres.

In explaining this law, Brandon references the magic system of Superman, claiming that Superman's powers aren't what make him interesting, but his limits, specifically his vulnerability to kryptonite and the code of ethics he received from his parents.

'''Lech, Čech, and Rus''' is a legend of three brothers &amp;ndash; Lech, Čech (or '''Czech'''), and Rus &amp;ndash; who founded three Slavic nations: '''[[Lechia]]''' ([[Poland]]), '''[[Czechia]]''' ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]]; thus modern [[Czech Republic]]), and '''[[Ruthenia]]''' (''[[Rus' people|Rus']]'', modern [[Russia]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]). There are multiple versions of the legend, including several regional variants that mention only one or two of the brothers.
==Variants of the legend==
[[Image:Lech 111.PNG|thumb|upright|left|Lech, Czech, Rus and the [[Coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]], as painted by [[Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski]] (1841–1905)]]
In the Polish version of the legend, three brothers went hunting together but each of them followed a different prey and eventually they all traveled in different directions. Rus went to the east, Čech headed to the west to settle on the [[Říp Mountain]] rising up from the Bohemian hilly countryside, while Lech traveled north. There, while hunting, he followed his arrow and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a fierce, white eagle guarding its nest from intruders. Seeing the eagle against the red of the setting sun, Lech took this sight as a good omen and decided to settle there. He named his [[Gord (Slavic settlement)|settlement]] [[Gniezno]] ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''gniazdo'' - 'nest') in commemoration and adopted the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|White Eagle]] as his [[coat-of-arms]]. The white eagle remains a symbol of Poland to this day, and the color of the eagle and the color of the setting sun are depicted in Poland's flag.

Other variations of Lech's name (pronounced {{IPA-pl|ˈlɛx|}}) include: '''Lechus''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Reges Et Principes Regni Poloniae]] Adrian Kochan Wolski; Riksarkivet E 8603; BUV 18.24.1.17 [http://www.staropolska.gimnazjum.com.pl/barok/Varia/Wolski.html] Quote: LECHUS adest, a quo deducta colonia nostra est.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lachus''', '''Lestus''' and '''Leszek'''. Czech, or '''Praotec Čech''' (pronounced {{IPA-cs|ˈpra.otɛts ˈtʃɛx|}}; Forefather Čech) also comes under the [[Latin]] name '''Bohemus''' or [[German language|German]] '''Böhm''', for the name is based on a pre-Slavic Celtic designation (Celtic tribe Boii, Latin form Boiohaemum that was used for Czech lands).&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Osiander, [http://books.google.com/books?id=OvQuck1BcE4C&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=Latin+name+Bohemus&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=_ICHTIW9K9HIswbd86ycCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Latin%20name%20Bohemus&amp;f=false ''Before the state: systemic political change in the West from the Greeks to the French Revolution''], pg. 241, Oxford University Press (2008), ISBN 0-19-829451-4&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this legend, involving only two brothers, is also known in the [[Czech Republic]]. As described by [[Alois Jirásek]] in ''Staré pověsti české'', two brothers came to Central Europe from the east: Čech and Lech. As in the Polish version, Čech is identified as the founder of the [[Czechs|Czech nation]] (''Češi'' pl.) and Lech as the founder of the [[Polish nation]]. Čech had to climb up the mountain [[Říp]], look to the landscape and settled with a tribe in the area, whereas Lech continued to the lowlands of the north.

A similar legend (with partly changed names) was also registered in folk tales at two separated locations in [[Croatia]]: in the [[Kajkavian dialect]] of Krapina in [[Zagorje]] (northern Croatia) and in the [[Chakavian dialect]] of Poljica on the [[Adriatic Sea]] (central [[Dalmatia]]). The Croatian variant was described and analysed in detail by S. Sakač in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Krapina-Kijev-Ararat, ''Priča o troje braće i jednoj sestri''. Život 21/3: 129–149, Zagreb&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend versus reality==
[[File:Balto-Slavic lng.png|thumb|left|200px|Area of Balto-Slavic dialectic continuum (''purple'') with proposed material cultures correlating to speakers Balto-Slavic in Bronze Age (''white''). ''Red'' dots= archaic Slavic hydronyms]]

The earliest Polish mention of Lech, Čech and Rus is found in the ''[[Chronicle of Greater Poland]]''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fix hiis itaque Pannoniis tres fratres filii Pan principis Pannoniorum nati fuere quorum primogenitus Lech, alter Rus, tercius Czech nomine habuerunt. Et hii tres hec tria regna Lechitarum, Ruthenorum, et Czechorum quit et Bohemi [...] Germo est quaddam instrumentum in quo duo boves simul iuncti trahendo aratrum seu plaustrum incedunt, sic et Theutunici cum slavis regna contigua habentes simul  ...&quot;  Translation: Among the Pannonians, therefore, three brothers were born to Pan, prince of the Pannonians. The first was named Lech, the second Rus and the third Czech. These three held the three kingdoms of the Lechites [Poles], Russians and Czechs (or Bohemians) […] Germo is a type of vehicle in which two oxen are yoked together to draw a plough or pull a cart, and so the Germans and the Slavs, having common borders, pull together; there is no people in the world so familiar and friendly to one another as the Slavs and Germans. [in:] Chronica Poloniae Maioris. Kronika Wielkopolska. ed. and commentary by Brygida Kürbis.  Warszawa 1970 &lt;/ref&gt; written in 1295 in Gniezno or [[Poznań]]. In Bohemian chronicles, Čech appears on his own or with Lech only; he is first mentioned as ''Bohemus'' in [[Cosmas of Prague|Cosmas]]' chronicle (1125).

The legend suggests the common ancestry of the [[Poles]], the [[Czechs]] and the [[Ruthenians]] ([[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]]) and illustrates the fact that as early as the 13th century, at least three different Slavic peoples were aware of being ethnically and linguistically interrelated, and, indeed, derived from a common root stock. 
[[Image:Cech2.gif|thumb|right|200px|Duke Czech]]

The legends also agree with the location of the homeland of the [[Slavic peoples]] in eastern Europe. This area overlapped the region presumed by mainstream scholarship to be the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] homeland in the general region of the Pontic-Caspian steppe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthony2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World |last=Anthony |first=David W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn=978-0-691-05887-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]], &quot;the Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations became speakers of Balto-Slavic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf F. Kortlandt, The spread of the Indo-Europeans], p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend also attempts to explain the etymology of these people's [[ethnonym]]s: [[Lechia]] (another name for Poland), the [[Czech lands]] (including Bohemia, [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]]), and [[Rus' (region)|Ruś]] (Ruthenia).

A prominent [[Polish Renaissance|Renaissance]] Polish [[man of letters]], [[Jan Kochanowski]], in his essay on the origin of the [[Slavs]], makes no mention of the third &quot;brother&quot;, Rus. Moreover, he dismisses the legend entirely, stating that &quot;no historian who has taken up the subject of the Slavic nation [...] mentions any of those two Slavic leaders, Lech and Czech&quot;. He goes on to assume that &quot;Czechy&quot; and &quot;Lachy&quot; are quite probably the original names for the two nations, although he does not dismiss the possibility that there might have been a great leader by the name Lech whose name replaced the original and later forgotten name for the Polish nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Kochanowski, ''Proza polska'', Universitas, Kraków 2004, pp. 19-21 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oaks of Rogalin==
[[Image:RogalinOaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lech, Czech and Rus oaks in [[Rogalin]], [[Poland]]]]
'''Lech, Czech''' and '''Rus''' are three ancient large [[oak]]s in the garden adjacent to the 18th century palace in [[Rogalin]], [[Greater Poland]]. Each of them is several hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Taylor, [http://books.google.com/books?id=S1zI1zwIFcUC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=Oaks+of+Rogalin&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=v3iHTNHpIIjMswb9yOmRCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Oaks%20of%20Rogalin&amp;f=false ''The Oxford companion to the garden''], pg. 411, Oxford University Press (2006), ISBN 0-19-866255-6&lt;/ref&gt; They vary between 23 and 30 feet in circumference. They've been declared natural landmarks and placed under protection.
